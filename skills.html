                <h4>Github</h4>
                <p>Github contains all of my repositories. From the day I started to write code, I have used
                    Github
                    and have become very familiar with it's interface and features. I have become very
                    comfortable
                    in working with Github throughout my coding journey so far.</p>
                <h4>Agile methodology</h4>
                <p>Agile methodology was a core component used in the development of my projects. I used Github
                    Issues to determine the features of my projects to prioritize and label their urgency. This
                    allowed me to select which features to work on first and I learned how to work with User
                    Stories
                    to determine the features desired by users.</p>
                <h4>SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)</h4>
                <p>Search engine optimisation is one of the most importanty skills that I have learned with Code
                    Institute. Every project contains SEO as a priority as this will help websites rank higher
                    in
                    search results. The SEO strategies I implemented are the use of keywords and a description
                    in
                    the head element of my HTML files. This targets words and phrases that a user may search for
                    and
                    will find on that specific html file. Along with this, the website will contain many
                    descriptive
                    phrases and words which align with the purpose of the website. I have learned to not spam
                    such
                    keywords but instead use them in a smooth flowing technique which search engines will
                    recognise
                    and will rank accordingly to search criteria.</p>
                <h4>Design thinking</h4>
                <p>As part of Code Institute's Full-Stack software developer course, I also learned the basic
                    rules
                    to Web Design. These include the choice of colour paletts, layout of the web page according
                    to
                    where a user looks to the most and to allow for a smooth UX (User experience). This is also
                    visible in the planning process of my projects and is documented in the Readme file. I have
                    learned how to layout a website that looks appealing, learned to pick out a selection of
                    colours
                    that will match throughout the website but also to match the genre of website that I am
                    developing.</p>

                    <h6>Front-End (My preference)</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="highlight">HTML5:</span> I am very proficient in HTML5 since I have
                            started
                            my
                            development journey by learning it. Having gone through dozens of projects all
                            involving
                            HTML5, I have learned how to use it optimally in any website layout.</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">CSS3: </span>Throughout the past year, CSS has become one of
                            my
                            favourite parts of development as it allows for the manipulation of layout in
                            incredible
                            ways and I have developed a passion to learn as much as possible about styling a
                            website
                            to
                            allow for fun interactivity for users.</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">JavaScript: </span>With JavaScript being one of the most
                            used
                            programming languages, it made sense for me to put focus into it. This has now
                            developed
                            into being my favourite programming language and I have learned to understand
                            JavaScript
                            syntax very well and feel comfortable in using it. JavaScript has become an
                            essential
                            part
                            of my projects and this has allowed me to keep on improving my skills with
                            JavaScript. I
                            am
                            familiar with ES6 and Vanilla JS versions.</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Bootstrap: </span>Bootstrap is the CSS framework that I have
                            become
                            most accostomed to using in my projects for responsiveness. I am extremely
                            comfortable
                            with
                            using Bootstrap in development of any project.</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">jQuery: </span>Along with learning JavaScript, I have also
                            taken
                            the
                            time to understand the functionality of jQuery which has allowed me to work with JS
                            a
                            lot
                            more efficiently. My skill set with jQuery is still in development but I have a very
                            good
                            understanding of it to use it in everyday scenarios.</li>

                        <li><span class="highlight">Python: </span>I have over 8 months of coding experience
                            using
                            Python, even though I prefer to work on Front-End, this experience allows me to
                            understand
                            how Back-End works and how Python is incorporated into projects.</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Django: </span>Django has been the framework that I have
                            become
                            familiar with throughout my learning and I have a deep understanding of Django which
                            like
                            Python allows me to know how Full Stack projects work between both Ends.</li>
